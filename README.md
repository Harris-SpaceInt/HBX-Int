# node-project-server
node-project-server is a MEAN (Mongodb, Express, Angularjs, Node.js) web application that focuses on streamlining and automating the process of submitting project reports at Harris Corportation to track savings throughout the company.

The client-side is built using Angularjs (with Foundation css framework for styling), and uses SPA (Single Page Application) principals such as angular routing to deliver a seamless user experience navigating through the application. 
The middleware of the application uses Express.js to provide a REST api for the client application to share data with a Mongodb database.
